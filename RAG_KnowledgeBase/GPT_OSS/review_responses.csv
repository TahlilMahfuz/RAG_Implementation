In the authentic Uthmani text the word is written with a **fatha** (ـَ) because it is the accusative object of the verb **خَلَقَ** (“He created the death and the life”). This is the standard orthography used in all printed Mushafs and verified digital copies, so the app’s rendering follows the correct Qurʾanic script.

If the display looks different on your device, please try the following:  
1. Ensure the app is updated to the latest version via the Play Store/App Store.  
2. In the Settings, select the “Uthmani Script” font option and enable “High‑Resolution Text”.  
3. If the issue persists, capture a screenshot and submit it through our feedback portal at **feedback.gtaf.org** so the team can investigate the rendering on your device.

May Allah increase us all in knowledge and grant ease in our worship. BarakAllahu feekum, and may He accept from you and us."
