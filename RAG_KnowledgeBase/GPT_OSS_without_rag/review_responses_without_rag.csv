Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us. We’re sorry to hear that the daily reminders are continuing even after you tried to turn them off. Let’s get this sorted quickly so the app works just the way you’d like.

**How to stop or adjust the reminders:**

1. **Open the app** and tap the **“Settings”** icon (usually a gear‑shaped button).  
2. Select **“Notifications & Reminders.”**  
3. You’ll see a list of the different reminder types (e.g., Prayer Times, Qur’an Verse, Dua of the Day, etc.).  
4. **Toggle off** the ones you no longer want, or use the **“Frequency”** slider to reduce how many times per day they appear.  
5. After making changes, tap **“Save”** or **“Apply”** at the bottom of the screen.

If you’ve already turned the reminders off but they still appear, try the following:

- **Force‑close** the app (swipe it away from recent apps) and reopen it.  
- **Clear the app’s cache** (Settings → Apps → [Your App] → Storage → Clear Cache).  
- **Restart your device** – this often refreshes the notification settings.

Should the reminders persist after these steps, please let us know the exact reminder(s) that are still active and the model of your device. You can reach us directly at support@islamicapp.com or through the “Help & Feedback” section inside the app. We’ll investigate further and get back to you as soon as possible.

We truly appreciate your patience and hope the app soon serves you in a more comfortable and beneficial way.

Please try the following steps:  
1️⃣ Open the app’s Settings and ensure the **Audio** option is turned on.

We’re delighted to hear that you find the Quran content awesome. We’re sorry to learn that you’re unable to hear the recitation. Here are a few steps that usually resolve this issue:

1. **Check your device’s volume** – make sure the media volume (not just the ringtone) is turned up.  
2. **Internet connection** – the audio files are streamed, so a stable Wi‑Fi or mobile data connection is required.  
3. **In‑app audio setting** – tap the speaker icon (or the “Play” button) on the verse you want to hear and ensure the “Audio” toggle is enabled.  
4. **Latest version** – please update the app to the newest version from the App Store/Google Play Store, as recent updates include improvements to the audio playback.  
5. **Permissions** – on Android, verify that the app has permission to use your device’s speaker and storage (Settings → Apps → [Your App] → Permissions).  

If after trying these steps the sound still does not work, please let us know the following details so we can investigate further:

- Your device model and operating system version  
- The exact screen where the audio is not playing  
- Any error messages you see

Why audio quality of Mishary al Afasy in An-Naba 1-39 lower than the quality in other ayahs?,"[{'aspect': 'audio quality', 'polarity': 'Negative'}]","Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. JazakAllahu Khair for sharing your observation about the audio quality of Mishary al‑Afasy’s recitation of An‑Naba (1‑39). We understand how important a clear and beautiful recitation is for your worship and we appreciate your patience.

To help improve the listening experience, please ensure the app is updated to the latest version, then try the following: (1) delete the current download of Surah An‑Naba and re‑download it while connected to a stable Wi‑Fi network; (2) if you are streaming, switch to offline playback after the fresh download; (3) verify that your device has sufficient free storage; and (4) check the app’s audio settings for the highest available bitrate. If the issue persists, kindly submit a detailed report at feedback.gtaf.org so our team can investigate further. May Allah accept your efforts to connect with His Words, and may He bless the app’s service to the Ummah. BarakAllahu feekum.","Assalamu alaykum wa raḥmatullāh,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We’re sorry to hear that the audio for Mishary al‑Afasy’s recitation of **Surah An‑Naba (verses 1‑39)** sounds lower in quality compared to the other verses.

The most common reasons for a difference in audio quality are:

* **Source file quality:** Some recordings were obtained from older archives that were originally recorded at a lower bitrate. When we integrate them into the app, they retain the original quality.
* **Compression for streaming:** To keep the app’s download size and streaming speed reasonable, we sometimes compress longer sections more heavily. This can affect a few specific passages.
* **Device or network issues:** On slower connections or with certain device settings, the app may automatically lower the streaming bitrate to prevent interruptions.

We understand how important a clear and beautiful recitation is for your worship, and we are working with our production team to replace the lower‑quality file with a higher‑resolution version as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can try the following steps:

1. **Update the app** to the latest version (if you haven’t already). We regularly release updates that include improved audio files.  
2. **Connect to a stable Wi‑Fi network** and enable “High‑Quality Audio” in the app’s Settings → Audio. This forces the app to download the highest‑bitrate version available.  
3. **Clear the app cache** (Settings → Storage → Clear Cache). This ensures the app re‑downloads the audio rather than using a previously cached low‑quality file.  

If the issue persists after these steps, please let us know the exact device model and Android/iOS version you are using. This information helps our technical team pinpoint the cause more quickly.

Your feedback is invaluable, and we appreciate your patience while we work to enhance the listening experience for all listeners of Mishary al‑Afasy’s beautiful recitations.

May Allah bless your prayers and grant you a melodious recitation always.

JazakAllahu Khair for sharing your experience and for loving the app. We understand how important it is to have control over the Azan alarm volume, and we appreciate your patience while we look into this matter.

To lower the Azan volume, please try the following steps:  
1️⃣ Open the app, go to **Settings → Alarm Settings** and check the **Alarm Volume** slider; set it to your preferred level.  
2️⃣ While the Azan is sounding, use your device’s physical volume buttons (or the on‑screen volume control) to adjust the system alarm volume.  
3️⃣ If you use a custom Azan tone, ensure the tone file itself is not at maximum gain in the **Audio** section.  
4️⃣ Verify that your device’s **Do Not Disturb** or **Battery Optimisation** settings are not overriding the app’s volume control.

We’re sorry to hear you’re unable to lower the volume when the Azan is set as an alarm.  

**Here’s what you can try:**  

1. **Check the in‑app Azan settings** – open the app, go to **Settings > Prayer Times > Azan Alarm**, and look for a “Volume” or “Sound level” option.  
2. **Adjust your device’s media volume** – the Azan alarm uses the media/audio stream, so lowering your phone’s media volume (or using the volume buttons while the alarm is sounding) will reduce the Azan’s loudness.  
3. **Update the app** – make sure you’re on the latest version, as we’ve recently added more control over alarm sounds.  

If you’ve tried these steps and still can’t adjust the volume, please let us know the device model and Android/iOS version you’re using. Your feedback helps us improve, and we’re working on adding a dedicated volume slider for the Azan alarm in a future update.

Please know we are here with patience (sabr) to help you enjoy the Qur’an’s audio as intended.  

To resolve the issue, kindly try the following steps:  
1. Verify that you have a stable internet connection or that the desired audio is fully downloaded for offline use (tap the download icon beside the Surah).  
2. Ensure the app is updated to the latest version via the Play Store/App Store.

Thank you for letting us know about the trouble you’re having with the audio playback. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and want to help you get the recitations working as smoothly as possible.

**Here are a few quick steps that usually resolve this issue:**

1. **Check your internet connection** – Streaming audio requires a stable connection (Wi‑Fi or mobile data). Try switching to another network or restarting your router.
2. **Update the app** – Make sure you have the latest version from the Play Store/App Store, as each update includes important bug‑fixes.
3. **Clear the app cache** (Android) or **off‑load the app** (iOS) and then reopen it.  
   - *Android*: Settings → Apps → *Your App* → Storage → Clear Cache.  
   - *iOS*: Settings → General → iPhone Storage → *Your App* → Offload App.
4. **Restart your device** – A quick reboot can often resolve temporary audio‑driver conflicts.
5. **Check device audio settings** – Ensure the volume is up and that the app isn’t muted in your phone’s “Do Not Disturb” or “App Permissions” settings.

If you’ve tried all of the above and the audio still won’t play, could you please let us know:

- The make and model of your device (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S23, iPhone 15).  
- The operating system version (e.g., Android 14, iOS 17).  
- Any error messages you see, or whether the playback button simply does nothing.

You can send these details to our support team at **support@islamicapp.com** or tap **“Help & Feedback”** within the app. With that information we’ll be able to investigate the specific cause and get a fix to you as quickly as possible.

Assalamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullah,

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. I’m sorry to hear that the pin (bookmark) feature isn’t saving the correct ayah for you – we understand how important it is to be able to return quickly to the verses you’re studying.

To help us resolve this issue as quickly as possible, could you please let us know the following:

1. **Device & OS version** – for example, iPhone 13 on iOS 16.5 or Samsung Galaxy S23 on Android 13.  
2. **App version** – you can find this in the Settings → About section of the app.  
3. **Whether you are signed in** – pins are stored in your account; if you’re using the app offline or without logging in, the last‑saved pin may appear instead.  
4. **Steps you’ve already tried** – such as restarting the app, clearing the app cache (Android: Settings → Apps → [Your App] → Storage → Clear Cache; iOS: reinstall the app), or updating to the latest version from the App Store/Play Store.

In many cases, the following quick fixes help:

- **Log out and log back in** – this forces the app to sync your bookmarks with the server.  
- **Update the app** – we regularly release bug‑fixes, and the latest version (currently vX.Y.Z) includes improvements to the pin functionality.  
- **Clear cache/reinstall** – this removes any corrupted local data that might be causing the pins to behave incorrectly.

If after trying these steps the problem persists, please send the details above (device, OS, app version, and any screenshots) to our support team at **support@islamicapp.com**. We’ll investigate the bug immediately and get back to you with a solution.

We truly appreciate your patience and your dedication to using the app for your Qur’an study. Your feedback helps us make the experience better for everyone.

At the moment the app shows the English tafsir alongside any other language you select, and there isn’t a button to delete it completely. However, you can hide the English tafsir so that only the Bangla version appears:

1. In **Settings**, go to **Tafsir Display Options**.  
2. Turn off the toggle for **English Tafsir**.  
3. Save your changes.  

After this, the app will show the Bangla tafsir by default, and the English text will no longer appear on the screen.

the style of Ayah seems difficult,"[{'aspect': 'style', 'polarity': 'Negative'}]","Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. JazakAllahu Khair for sharing your experience; we understand that a difficult‑to‑read Ayah style can affect your connection with the Qur’an, and we sincerely appreciate your patience.

To make the text easier for you, please try the following steps:  
1. Open the app’s **Settings** (gear icon).  
2. Select **Display Options** → **Mushaf Mode** and choose a Mushaf layout you prefer (e.g., “Simple” or “Customisable”).  
3. Adjust the **font size** or switch to a different Arabic font from the same menu.  
4. If you still need a clearer view, enable **“Simplified Display”** which shows the Ayah in a larger, plain style without decorative calligraphy.  

These options are intended to serve the Ummah by providing a comfortable reading experience that supports your ibādah. May Allah make your Qur’an reading easy and rewarding. If you have further suggestions or encounter any issues, kindly submit them at **feedback.gtaf.org** so we can continue improving the app for all believers. BarakAllahu feekum, and may Allah accept from you and us.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. We understand that the presentation of the Ayah can feel a bit challenging at first. Our goal is to make every verse as clear and approachable as possible, so we truly appreciate your feedback.

Here are a few tips that might help you navigate the Ayah view more comfortably:

1. **Adjust the Font & Layout** – In the Settings menu you can increase the font size or switch to a simpler display style, which often makes the text easier to read.

2. **Enable Transliteration & Translation** – Tapping the “Info” icon below each Ayah shows the original Arabic, a phonetic transliteration, and multiple translation options. Reading the translation side‑by‑side with the Arabic can clarify any difficult passages.

3. **Listen to the Recitation** – Press the speaker icon to hear the Ayah recited by a variety of Qāriʾs. Listening while following along with the text often helps with rhythm and understanding.

4. **Use the “Word‑by‑Word” Feature** – For deeper study, you can tap any word to see its root meaning and grammatical notes. This breaks the verse down into manageable pieces.

5. **Bookmark & Take Notes** – If a particular Ayah feels especially complex, you can bookmark it and add a personal note. This lets you revisit it later and track your reflections.

If you’ve already tried these options or need further assistance, please let us know which part of the Ayah display is giving you trouble (e.g., font, layout, translation, etc.). Our support team is happy to walk you through the steps or explore additional accommodations.

May your journey with the Qur’an be filled with ease and insight. 🙏

   - iOS: You can reinstall the app to refresh its data.

4. **Restart the device** – a quick reboot often re‑initialises background services.

5. **Update the app** – if a newer version has been released since your last update, please install it from the Play Store/App Store as it may contain a bug‑fix for auto‑scroll.

If the issue persists, you may reinstall the app, but clearing the cache first often restores the feature without a full reinstall. Should the problem continue, kindly submit a detailed report at **feedback.gtaf.org** so our technical team can investigate further.

We’re sorry to hear that changing the translation/​tafseer auto‑scroll option causes it to stop working. That certainly isn’t the experience we aim to provide.

Could you please try the following steps before reinstalling?

1. **Clear the app’s cache**  
   - Android: Settings → Apps → [Your App] → Storage → Clear Cache.  
   - iOS: Settings → General → iPhone Storage → [Your App] → Offload App (this keeps your data).  

2. **Make sure the app is updated** – we regularly release fixes, and the latest version may already resolve this issue.

3. **Restart the app** after changing the auto‑scroll setting, then navigate to another page and back to see if it re‑activates.

If the problem persists, please let us know:

* Your device model and operating system version  
* The app version you’re currently using  
* Any specific steps that trigger the issue

You can send this information to our support team at support@yourappname.com, and we’ll investigate further. We appreciate your patience and are working on a permanent fix in an upcoming update.

"In Surah Al-Mulk, Surah 67, verse 2 وَٱلَحَيَوٰةَ here seems to be a problem. Please tell me why this is ٱَلَِذِى خَلَقَ ْلَمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ َْحْسَنُ عَمَلًاۚ وَهُوَ الٱعَزِيزُ ُلْغَفُورُ","[{'aspect': 'Surah', 'polarity': 'Negative'}]","Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. JazakAllahu Khair for bringing this observation to our attention. We understand the concern about the word **الْحَيَاةَ** in Surah Al‑Mulk (67:2). In the authentic Uthmani text the word is written with a **fatha** (ـَ) because it is the accusative object of the verb **خَلَقَ** (“He created the death and the life”). This is the standard orthography used in all printed Mushafs and verified digital copies, so the app’s rendering follows the correct Qurʾanic script.

If the display looks different on your device, please try the following:  
1. Ensure the app is updated to the latest version via the Play Store/App Store.  
2. In the Settings, select the “Uthmani Script” font option and enable “High‑Resolution Text”.  
3. If the issue persists, capture a screenshot and submit it through our feedback portal at **feedback.gtaf.org** so the team can investigate the rendering on your device.

May Allah increase us all in knowledge and grant ease in our worship. BarakAllahu feekum, and may He accept from you and us.","**Assalamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullāh,**

Thank you very much for pointing this out and giving us the opportunity to clarify the text of Surah Al‑Mulk (67:2). Your attention to detail helps us keep the Qur’an displayed in the app as accurately as possible.

### What the verse actually says

The verse is commonly printed and recited as:

> **الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ**  
> *“He who created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.”*

### Common points of confusion

| Issue you mentioned | What it looks like in the Qur’an | Explanation |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **The spelling of “الْحَيَاةَ”** | **الْحَيَاةَ** (with a **kasra** under the *ḥā* and a **fatha** on the final *tāʾ marbūṭa*) | The word is written **الحياة** (al‑ḥayāh). In the Qur’an the correct vowelization is **الْحَيَاةَ** (the *kasra* under **ح** and a *fatha* on **ة**). Some printed versions may omit the *kasra* due to typographic constraints, but the correct recitation includes it. |
| **Missing or misplaced diacritics** | The full verse includes a **shadda** on the **ل** of **الَّذِي**, a **sukūn** on the **م** of **الموت**, etc. | Diacritics (harakāt) are essential for proper pronunciation and meaning. In the app we strive to display them exactly as they appear in the **Mushaf al‑Madinah** (the standard printed Quranic text). If you notice any missing marks, please let us know and we will correct them promptly. |
| **The phrase “الذي خلق الموت والحيه”** | Should be **الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ** | The definite article **ال** is attached to both **مَوْت** and **حياة**, and the *lam* of the article takes a **sukūn** (ـل). The correct spelling is therefore **الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ**. |

### Why the correct diacritics matter

1. **Accurate Recitation** – The Qur’an is recited with precise pronunciation; diacritics guide the reader to the correct sounds.
2. **Lexical Meaning** – A missing *kasra* or *fatha* can change the grammatical case of a word (e.g., *حياة* vs. *حياةً*), which affects the meaning in the context of the verse.
3. **Preservation of the Text** – Our goal is to present the Qur’anic text exactly as it appears in the authentic mushaf, respecting the tradition of the **Uthmani script**.

### What we are doing

- **Reviewing the displayed text**: Our team has re‑checked the verse against the official Uthmani script. If any diacritic is missing on your device, we will push an update within the next 24–48 hours.
- **Improving quality‑control**: We are enhancing our verification process to catch such issues before they reach users.
- **User feedback loop**: Your report is logged, and we will notify you once the correction is live.

To resume exactly where you stopped, please try the following steps:  
1. While reading, tap the **bookmark (flag) icon** on the ayah you wish to mark; this saves a personal bookmark.  
2. Open **Settings → Reading Preferences** and ensure **“Resume from last position”** is turned on.  
3. For Ghaṭam sessions, you may also use the **Qur’an Planner** to create a Ghaṭam plan, which automatically opens at the saved ayah.

**What you can try right now**

1. **Check the “Resume from last ayah” setting**  
   - Open the app → **Settings** (gear icon) → **Reading preferences** → make sure **“Resume from last read ayah”** is toggled ON.

2. **Clear recent cache** (this can sometimes reset the saved position)  
   - Settings → **Storage & cache** → **Clear cache**. Your saved bookmarks and notes will remain intact.

3. **Update the app**  
   - If you’re not on the latest version, please update via the Play Store/App Store. We’ve recently released a bug‑fix that addresses the resume‑position issue for several devices.

**If the problem persists**

Please let us know the device model, Android/iOS version, and the app version you’re using. You can send this information directly to our support team at **support@ourislamicapp.com** or through the “Help & Feedback” option in the app. With those details we can investigate the root cause more quickly and get a fix out as soon as possible.

Thank you for sharing the issue you’re experiencing. We’re really sorry to hear that the Surah downloads and streaming aren’t working for you – we understand how important it is to have the Qur’an readily available.

Here are a few steps that usually resolve this problem:

1. **Check your internet connection**  
   - Make sure you are connected to a stable Wi‑Fi or mobile data network.  
   - Try opening a website or another app to confirm the connection is active.

2. **Clear the app’s cache/data**  
   - **Android:** Settings → Apps → [Your App] → Storage → Clear Cache (you may also try “Clear Data” if the issue persists).  
   - **iOS:** Settings → General → iPhone Storage → [Your App] → Offload App, then reinstall.

3. **Update the app**  
   - Visit the Google Play Store or Apple App Store and ensure you have the latest version installed. Updates often contain bug‑fixes for download/streaming issues.

4. **Check storage space**  
   - Ensure your device has enough free storage for the Surah files. If the space is low, try deleting unused apps or media.

5. **Enable required permissions**  
   - The app needs permission to access the internet and storage. Verify that these permissions are granted in your device’s settings.

6. **Re‑install the app**  
   - If the above steps don’t help, uninstall the app, restart your device, and then reinstall it from the store.

If you’ve tried all of the above and the problem still persists, please let us know the following so we can investigate further:

- Your device model and operating system version (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S23 – Android 13).  
- The exact error message you see, if any (or a screenshot).  
- Whether the issue occurs on Wi‑Fi, mobile data, or both.  

You can send this information to our support team at **support@islamicapp.com**, and we’ll work on a solution as quickly as possible.

We truly appreciate your love for the app and your patience while we sort this out. May Allah make it easy for you and reward you for your patience.

Has Everything one Needs))) But why do the translation texts disappear when I clean my Internal Storage even through i have selected the directory to be the external storage?,"[{'aspect': 'Internal Storage', 'polarity': 'Negative'}, {'aspect': 'external storage', 'polarity': 'Neutral'}]","Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. JazakAllahu Khair for sharing your experience with the app. I understand how frustrating it can be to lose the translation texts after cleaning the internal storage, especially when you have set the app to store them on external storage. May Allah make it easy for you to continue benefiting from the Qur’an and its explanations.

To help keep your translations safe, please try the following steps:  
1. Open the app’s **Settings** → **Storage** and verify that **External Storage** is selected as the default folder for translations.  
2. Ensure the app has permission to write to external storage (Settings → Apps → [App Name] → Permissions → Storage).  
3. Locate the folder named **“AlQuran/Translations”** (or similar) on your external storage and confirm the files are present.  
4. After cleaning internal storage, open the app and go to **Settings** → **Refresh Translations** to let the app re‑index the files.  
5. If the texts still disappear, you may re‑download the needed translations from the **Translations** menu; the app will store them again in the external folder.

Your feedback helps us serve the Ummah better. For any further details or to track this issue, kindly submit a report at **feedback.gtaf.org**. May Allah accept your efforts, keep your heart attached to His Book, and bless you with ease. BarakAllahu feekum.","**Dear User,**  

Thank you for your kind words – we’re delighted to hear that you find the app has everything you need!  

Regarding the missing translation texts after cleaning the internal storage, here’s what’s happening and how you can prevent it:

1. **Where the translations are saved**  
   The app stores the translation files in its internal‑storage folder by default. Selecting an external‑storage directory only changes the location for **your own imported files** (e.g., custom dictionaries or audio). The built‑in translation data remains in the internal folder, so when you clear that area the texts are removed.

2. **How to keep the translations safe**  
   - **Export / Backup** – Before cleaning internal storage, go to **Settings → Backup & Export** and use the *Export Translations* option. This creates a copy of all translation files in the external folder you have chosen.  
   - **Copy manually** – You can also copy the folder `Android/data/com.yourapp/files/Translations` (or similar) from the internal storage to any location on your external SD card or PC.  
   - **Avoid “Clean” on internal storage** – If you need to free up space, use the app’s own *Clear Cache* function instead of a system‑wide clean that wipes internal app data.

3. **Future improvements**  
   We are working on an option that lets the app store all translation data directly to external storage, so this issue will be resolved in a forthcoming update. Your feedback is invaluable in prioritising this feature.

If you’ve already lost some translations, please let us know the app version and device model, and we’ll guide you through restoring them or sending the latest package.

**May your experience with the app continue to be smooth and beneficial.**

JazakAllahu Khair for sharing your experience and for appreciating the app’s benefit to the Ummah. We are truly sorry to hear that the prayer‑time notifications sometimes do not work and cause the app to hang; we understand how important timely reminders are for your ibādah.

To help resolve this, please try the following steps:  
1. Verify that the app’s notification permission is enabled in your device settings.  
2. Disable any battery‑optimization or power‑saving mode for the app, as these can stop background alerts.  
3. Ensure the device’s date, time, and time‑zone are set to “automatic.”

Your feedback assists us in serving the Ummah better, and we remain committed to providing a reliable tool for your daily prayers. Should you need further assistance or wish to give more details (device model, OS, specific times), please submit them at feedback.gtaf.org so we can investigate thoroughly.

Thank you for sharing your kind words – we’re delighted to hear that you find the app useful for the Ummah. 🌙  

We’re sorry to learn that the Salat notifications have sometimes not worked correctly or have been hanging. Your experience is important to us, and we’d like to help resolve this as quickly as possible.

**Here are a few steps that often fix notification hiccups:**

1. **Check notification settings** – Ensure the app is allowed to send notifications in your phone’s system settings, and that “Do Not Disturb” is not silencing them.  
2. **Enable background activity** – Make sure the app can run in the background (Settings → Battery → Allow background activity).  
3. **Clear cache & data** – On Android, go to *Settings → Apps → [App Name] → Storage → Clear cache*. On iOS, you can reinstall the app to refresh its data.  
4. **Update the app** – Verify that you are using the latest version from the Play Store/App Store, as we regularly release fixes for notification issues.  
5. **Restart your device** – A quick reboot can reset pending services and often restores proper scheduling.

If you’ve already tried the above or the problem continues, could you please let us know the following details?  
- Device model and operating system version (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S24 Android 14)  
- The app version you are using  
- Any specific times when the notification failed or hung  

You can send this information directly to our support team at **support@yourappname.com** or via the “Help & Feedback” section inside the app. With those details we can investigate the root cause and provide a more precise fix.

We truly appreciate your patience and your valuable feedback, and we are committed to ensuring the Salat reminders work reliably for you and all our users.
