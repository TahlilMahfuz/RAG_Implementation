       "  'text': 'Deepening Quran Understanding: Tools for Students of Knowledge and Arabic Learners\\n\\nDeepen your understanding of the Quran through our comprehensive Arabic analysis tools.\\n\\nWhether you’re a beginner in Arabic or an advanced student of knowledge, our Quran app offers tools that make learning Arabic easier and more meaningful.\\n\\nLet’s look at how features like e3rab (morphology), gharib (uncommon Arabic word meanings), word root, lemma, grammar details, verb forms, word occurrences can help you.\\n\\nE3rab (Morphology)\\n\\nE3rab explains the grammatical structure of each word in the Quran. It helps you:\\n\\nUnderstand how words fit into an ayah\\n\\nSee how grammar changes the meaning of ayahs\\n\\nImprove your knowledge of Quranic Arabic grammar for deeper studies\\n\\nFor example, when you read Surah Al-Fatiha, you’ll see why “الحمد” and “لله” are written this way and how they connect.\\n\\nTo study E3rab, go to Settings > Tafsirs. You can download the E3rab by Qasim Hamidan Da’s from the list and start studying.\\n\\nGharib (Uncommon Arabic Word Meanings)\\n\\nThe Quran has words that are not often used in modern Arabic. The Gharib tool helps you:\\n\\nLearn the meanings of uncommon words\\n\\nUnderstand their context in Quranic ayahs\\n\\nBuild your vocabulary for classical and modern Arabic\\n\\nYou can download Gharib from the Tafsirs list. Currently, we have 2 Arabic word meanings.\\n\\nWord Lemma and Root\\n\\nRoots and lemmas are key to understanding Arabic. Our app highlights:\\n\\nLemma: See the base form of words to understand patterns and variations\\n\\nRoots: Learn the core meaning of words by studying their roots\\n\\nMost Arabic words come from three or four letter roots. This helps you see how words are connected, learn word families faster and spot patterns across the Quran.\\n\\nFor example, the words “book” (كتاب), “library” (مكتبة), and “writer” (كاتب) all come from ك-ت-ب. Once you know this, you’ll start seeing these patterns everywhere!\\n\\nYou can easily see the word lemma and root by tapping on a word in the app.\\n\\nWord occurrences in various forms and Quran Dictionary\\n\\nTracking how words appear in different forms in different places helps you:\\n\\nFind every instance of a word in the Quran and track word frequencies\\n\\nRemember words better by recognizing patterns\\n\\nStudy how the same word is used in different contexts\\n\\nBuild deeper understanding through cross-referencing\\n\\nAppreciate the beauty and consistency of the Quran\\n\\nFor example, the root ك-ت-ب was found 319 times in 7 derived forms (lemma) across the Quran. While one of the 7 lemmas كاتب was found 6 times.\\n\\nAfter tapping on a word, tap on “Click for more” to see the word occurrences.\\n\\nOur Quran dictionary organizes words by their root letters. You can browse the words by Arabic alphabet and roots to see all the derivatives for each root. Access the dictionary by clicking on menu drawer > dictionary.\\n\\nGrammar details\\n\\nGrammar for each word is labelled in the app. Grammar details make it easier to:\\n\\nSpot parts of speech like nouns, verbs, and adjectives\\n\\nUnderstand how the ayahs are formed\\n\\nVerb forms and conjugation\\n\\nVerbs are essential in Arabic. When you come across a verb, you can open it to see the verb forms and conjugation. It can help you:\\n\\nLearn verb forms like perfect, imperfect, imperative, active/passive participles and noun form\\n\\nUnderstand how verbs change with tense and case\\n\\nApply this knowledge to Quranic and modern Arabic\\n\\nCheck this article to learn more\\n\\nPractical Applications\\n\\nIdentify unfamiliar words using Gharib\\n\\nAnalyze grammatical structure with E3rab\\n\\nStudy word lemmas, roots and their relationships\\n\\nExplore similar usage across the Quran\\n\\nReview verb conjugations when encountered\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhether you are starting out learning Arabic or already an advanced student, these tools make learning Quranic Arabic easier and more effective.
