        "text": "Have you ever wondered how the Prophets greeted each other or shared a meal? In Islam, manners and etiquette are essential and impact how we interact with others daily. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a perfect example of kindness, generosity, and respect. His actions show us how to be good to others, treat people with care, and follow the teachings of Islam in every part of our lives.\n\nLearning good manners isn’t just about behaving well in front of others—it’s about following the Sunnah and earning the blessings of Allah. As Allah commands us in the Holy Quran: “And speak kindly to mankind” (Quran 2:83). Speaking kindly, helping others, and showing respect are all key parts of Islamic manners.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the wonderful stories of the Prophets and how they demonstrated beautiful manners. From saying “Bismillah” before eating to being kind to our neighbors and respecting our elders, there are many ways we can learn and practice the social etiquette of Muslims.\n\nTo learn more about the foundations of our faith, explore our Kid-Friendly Guide to Understanding the Five Pillars of Islam, which beautifully explains the core principles every young Muslim should know.\n\n1. The Story of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the Neighbor\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him said) was known for his incredible patience, kindness, and compassion. Even when people weren’t nice to him, he always responded with gentleness and forgiveness. One famous story from the life of the Prophet tells us about his neighbor, who treated him poorly.\n\nThis neighbor would throw garbage in front of the Prophet’s house every day. But the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) never retaliated or got angry. Instead, he remained patient and kind. One day, when the garbage wasn’t there, the Prophet visited the neighbor to check on him and found out he was sick. This simple act of kindness touched the neighbor’s heart so much that he became a follower of Islam.\n\nLesson: This story reminds us that kindness and patience can change hearts, even when others aren’t. Compassion is a vital part of good manners and reflects the teachings of our beloved Prophet Peace be upon him. Instead of responding angrily, we should follow the example of the Prophet peace and blessings, and forbidding evil.\n\nTips for Kids:\n\nPractice patience with your friends or siblings, especially when they annoy you.\n\nAlways greet others with “Salaam” (peace), just like the Prophet did, and spread kindness everywhere you go.\n\nTo deepen your understanding of the beauty and wisdom within the Holy Quran, check out our post on the Miracles of the Quran, highlighting the divine signs and blessings of Allah.\n\n2. Saying ‘Bismillah’ Before Eating\n\nDid you know that saying “Bismillah” before eating helps bring the blessings of Allah to your meal? “Bismillah” means “In the name of Allah,” and saying it before starting any meal reminds us that all the food we enjoy is a blessing from Allah.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) taught us to say “Bismillah” before eating and to use our right hand. As narrated by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet said: “Say Bismillah and eat with your right hand, and eat from what is in front of you” (Sahih Bukhari). Following this eating etiquette in Islam brings us closer to Allah peace and blessings to helps us remember to be thankful for what we have.\n\nSharing food with others is not just a kind gesture but also a Sunnah! The Prophet (PBUH) always encouraged sharing food with family and friends, as it spreads love and increases the blessings of Allah.\n\nTips for Kids:\n\nBefore eating, always remember to say “Bismillah” and use your right hand.\n\nShare your food with others to show generosity and earn the mercy and fear of Allah.\n\nDon’t forget to say, “Allahumma barik lana fihi wa minhu” (O Allah, bless us in it and from it).\n\nDiscover how our programs can help your child learn the Quran, Islamic manners, and more—visit our Islamic studies programs for engaging, faith-based education tailored for young Muslims.\n\n3. Cleanliness is Half of Faith\n\nCleanliness is an important part of Islam, and it is often said that “cleanliness is half of faith.” Keeping ourselves clean and tidy is not just about looking good; it’s also about respecting the blessings of Allah and keeping our surroundings pure.\n\nNoor loved playing with his toys but hated cleaning up afterward. His room would always be messy, and he didn’t like tidying up. But one day, his parents reminded him that keeping clean is an important part of being a good Muslim. Noor learned that cleaning up wasn’t just about making his room look nice—it was also about keeping his heart clean by being kind, honest, and respectful. After that, he started tidying up his room every day, feeling proud that he was following the teachings of the Prophet.\n\nIn the Holy Quran, it is said: “Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves” (Quran 2:222). This verse teaches us that keeping ourselves and our surroundings clean is something Allah loves.\n\nLesson: Cleanliness is about both the body and the heart. When we keep clean and tidy, we follow Islamic etiquette and show respect to Allah’s blessings.\n\nTips for Kids:\n\nTry a “clean-up challenge” at home! Set a timer and see how fast you can clean your room or help your parents around the house.\n\nRemember to keep your heart clean, too—be kind and honest in your thoughts and actions.\n\n4. Speaking Kindly\n\nThe words we use are powerful, and in Islam, we are taught to speak with kindness and care. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always used gentle words when speaking to others, even when he was frustrated. Speaking kindly can make someone’s day, and it can also bring peace to our hearts.\n\nOne day, Noor and Nora were playing, but they started to argue. Noor wanted to say something mean because he was upset, but then he remembered the teachings of the Prophet. Instead, Noor took a deep breath and spoke kindly to Nora, which made her smile. Soon, they were friends again!\n\nIn the Quran, Allah says: “And tell My servants to say that which is best. Indeed, Satan induces dissension among them” (Quran 17:53). This verse reminds us that kind words can bring people closer, while harsh words can create conflict.\n\nLesson: Words are like seeds—when we plant kind words, we grow love and friendships. When we plant mean words, we create hurt and distance.\n\nTips for Kids:\n\nPlay the “Kind Words” game with your family! Take turns saying the nicest things you can think of to each other and see who can come up with the best kind words.\n\nAlways speak to your friends, siblings, and family with kind and respectful words, just like the beloved Prophet (PBUH) did.\n\n5. Respecting Parents and Elders\n\nIn Islam, respecting our parents and elders is a key part of our manners. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always showed love and care toward his parents, grandparents, and other elders. He was gentle and kind toward them and always took the time to listen.\n\nNora loved visiting her grandparents, but sometimes she would forget to listen carefully to their stories. One day, she remembered how the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always respected his elders and made sure to give them his full attention. She decided to listen carefully when her grandparents told stories about their childhood, and she learned so many new things.\n\nThe Quran says: “And We have enjoined upon man goodness to parents” (Quran 29:8). This verse tells us that we must show love, respect, and kindness to our parents and elders.\n\nLesson: Respecting our parents and elders by listening to them, showing kindness, and asking them for advice helps strengthen our relationships with them.\n\nTips for Kids:\n\nAsk your parents or grandparents to tell you a story from their lives. It’s a great way to show respect and learn something new!\n\nAlways be polite when speaking to elders, using words like “please” and “thank you.”\n\n6. The Golden Rule in Islam\n\nDid you know that the famous rule “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” is also part of Islamic knowledge of teachings? The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself” (Sahih Bukhari). This means that we should treat others the way we want to be treated.\n\nTry a fun role-playing game with your family or friends! Take turns pretending to be different people—a friend who needs help, someone who feels sad, or someone who is sharing toys. Think about how you would want to be treated in those situations and act it out. It’s a fun way to practice the Golden Rule and learn more about how to treat others with kindness.\n\nLesson: By treating others with kindness, love, and respect, we follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and live a life that pleases Allah.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGood manners and etiquette in Islam are simple but powerful ways to live a life that pleases Allah. Simple acts like speaking kindly, staying clean, respecting elders, and treating others the way we want to be treated bring us closer to Allah and to each other. As narrated by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: “The best among you are those who have the best manners and character” (Sahih Bukhari).\n\nCall to Action: Why not start practicing one new manner each week? You could start by saying “Bismillah” before meals, cleaning your room, or speaking kindly to everyone you meet. These small acts bring the blessings of Allah into our lives and make the world a better place.\n\nFor more ways to teach your children about Islamic manners and etiquette, check out the helpful programs at Noor Academy. Let’s all work together to follow the example of the beloved Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and live with kindness, respect, and love."

        "title": "Common Islamic Greetings Phrases",
        "text": "Islamic Greetings and Responses\n\nThe primary Islamic greeting, “As-Salamu Alaikum” (السلام عليكم), translates to “Peace be upon you.” Derived from the Arabic root “S-L-M” (سلام), which signifies peace, safety, and submission to God, this phrase encapsulates Islam’s core mission: to establish tranquility in human hearts and societies. The customary reply, “Wa Alaikum As-Salam” (وعليكم السلام), meaning “And peace be upon you,” reciprocates this blessing, completing a spiritual exchange ordained by Allah.\n\n“As-Salamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh” (السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته), extends the prayer to include “and the mercy of Allah and His blessings,” emphasizing the believer’s desire for comprehensive divine benevolence upon others\n\nالسلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته\n\nAssalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh\n\nMay the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you\n\nAssalamu Alaikum (Peace be upon you) – A universal greeting fostering unity and goodwill.\n\n(Peace be upon you) – A universal greeting fostering unity and goodwill.

Indeed, Allah is ever, over all things, Accountant.”\n\nThis verse encourages Muslims to elevate social interactions through kindness, whether by replying with an equal or superior greeting. Prophetic Emphasis:\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) highlighted the importance of spreading Salam:\n\n“You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I inform you of something that makes you love one another? Spread Salam (greetings) among yourselves.” (Sahih Muslim).\n\nAnother Hadith underscores its spiritual merit: “The one who initiates Salam is free from pride.” (Al-Bukhari).\n\nIslamic Gratitude and Appreciation\n\nJazakAllah / JazakAllahu Khairan (May Allah reward you) – Expressing thanks.\n\n(May Allah reward you) – Expressing thanks. BarakAllahu Feek/Feekum (May Allah bless you) – A reply to gratitude.\n\n(May Allah bless you) – A reply to gratitude. Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allah) – Thanking Allah after blessings or challenges.\n\n(Praise be to Allah) – Thanking Allah after blessings or challenges.

Tabarak Allah (Blessed be Allah) – Reacting to joyous news.\n\nIslamic Supplications and Trust in Allah\n\nBismillah (In the name of Allah) – Starting any action with Allah’s name.\n\n(In the name of Allah) – Starting any action with Allah’s name. Insha Allah (If Allah wills) – Planning future endeavors with humility.\n\n(If Allah wills) – Planning future endeavors with humility.

Non-Verbal Gestures:\n\nGreetings often accompany a handshake, smile, or placing the right hand on the heart. Hugs (especially after long separation) are encouraged, following the Prophet’s example. Avoiding Greetings in Specific Contexts: If someone is praying, bathing, or occupied in private acts, greetings are paused to maintain decorum. Responding to Non-Muslims:\n\nThe Quran guides Muslims to reply courteously if non-Muslims offer greetings (Surah An-Nisa 4:86), though some scholars recommend responding with “Wa Alaikum” (And upon you) to distinguish beliefs.\n\nCommon Misconceptions\n\n“Salam is Only for Muslims”:\n\nWhile Muslims prioritize greeting fellow believers, Islam teaches kindness to all. The Quran says: “Allah does not forbid you from being kind to those who have not fought you…” (60:8). “Pride in Initiating Salam”:\n\nInitiating Salam is a virtue, not a weakness. The Prophet (ﷺ) stated, “The best of you are those who begin with Salam.” (Al-Bukhari)\n\nCultural Adaptations and Universal Spirit\n\nWhile As-Salamu Alaikum is universally Islamic, cultural nuances enrich its practice:\n\nIn Indonesia, “Salam” may pair with a hand-to-heart gesture.\n\nAfrican Muslims might blend traditional greetings with Salam.\n\nIn digital eras, Muslims abbreviate the greeting as “Salam” in texts or emails, preserving its essence amid modernity.\n\nYa Ghous al Madad in Arabic text\n\n5/5 - (7 votes)\n\nRelated\n\nNo related posts."

        "text": "When learning Arabic, one of the first things you’ll encounter is the beauty of Arabic greeting words. These greetings go beyond simple pleasantries—they carry deep meanings of respect, peace, and blessings, particularly in Muslim culture. Whether you’re greeting someone in everyday conversation or offering well wishes in religious contexts, learning how to greet in Arabic opens doors to understanding the rich cultural and spiritual nuances of the Arabic language.\n\nHow Do You Greet Someone in Arabic?\n\nArabic greetings are rich in culture and meaning. Each one offers something unique—sometimes a blessing, other times a gesture of respect. In this section, I’ll go through ten common Arabic greetings.

        "text": "The 75 Good Manners (Commandments) in The Quran\n\nIslamic Etiquette\n\n(List compiled by Islamicity Staff.)\n\nHuman nature desires a society based on morals and manners which provides a stable and secure life leading to liberty and happiness for all people.\n\nMuslims believe Prophet Muhammad had a character as a model for all humanity to follow.

        "title": "The Dignity of Islam's Social Etiquette",
        "text": "Cordially making room for newcomers in a gathering is a rule of refined conduct taught and encouraged by the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam.\n\nAllah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, says: \"O you who have believed, when you are told, 'Make room [for one another]' in gatherings, then make room; Allah will make room for you. And when you are told: 'Arise!' then arise. Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees. And Allah is acquainted with what you do\" [58:11].\n\nThis verse of the Qur'an holds divine instructions and rules of social conduct directed at avoiding discord, spreading care and friendliness among people, and maximizing the benefit of circles of knowledge when we are in them. These rules address assemblies, social gatherings, groups, and study circles. The first rule commands making space for newcomers when sitting in an assembly, allowing them to sit down, feel welcome and part of the assembly. This brings peace and strengthens ties.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, was so beloved by his Companions (Sahabah) that naturally, they sought to sit as close to him as possible, and if that meant they had to compete for a better place close to him, they did. This verse was, therefore, revealed, to address social manners and etiquette. Qatadah, of the great Successor (Tabi'ee) generation that came after the Companions, said commenting on this verse that \"it was revealed concerning assemblies of learning and discussion, for when they saw someone approaching, the Companions used to be reluctant to concede a space for him in their assemblies with Allah's Messenger, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam-and thus Allah's instruction to make space for each other.\"\n\nSeveral of the sayings of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, speak to the merits of making space at assemblies. One of these quoted by Ibn Umar says: \"Let no person get up only to have another to sit in his place, but rather make room and enlarge your circle\" (Bukhari and Muslim). Another version cited by Ahmad, says: \"...but rather make space, and Allah will make space for you.\"\n\nWhen room is made for someone, it should be accepted, and the person should sit down next to those who made it, and thank them. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, said: \"When people take their places and sit, and a man invites a [Muslim] brother of his and makes room for him, let the latter take it. It is a generous gesture offered to him, so let him sit there\" (Tabari).\n\nMaking room for newcomers in a gathering is a rule of refined conduct promoted by the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, and is characteristic of Islam. It is a sign of affability and mutual affection of all Muslims. It is both a courtesy and a good deed. When someone arrives late to a learning session, the people already there should make room, so that the latecomer may sit down , listen, and benefit from the discussion, rather than have him or her turn back with the excuse that no place is available or that the place is too tight, thus denying one the opportunity of learning. One hadith states that while Allah's Messenger, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, was sitting, three people approached. One of them found an opening in the circle and joined it. Another sat behind other people. The third turned back and left. Allah's Messenger said: \"Shall I give you an account of these three? The first took refuge with Allah. As for the second, he felt shy and sat behind the people. The third turned away, so Allah turned away from him.\"\n\nWe should not separate people from each other, for Allah's Messenger, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, said: \"It is not lawful for any man to separate two people without their permission\" (Abu Dawud and Tirmithi). Such separation may inconvenience them, for they may have special affection toward each other or may have been discussing a private matter. So separating them, by sitting between them, may disturb them.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, also said: \"No one among you should cause a man to stand and then sit in his place\" (Bukhari). A person who sits in a place first is more entitled to it. The best practice is for a person joining a group to sit next to the last person in it. Jabir Ibn Samurah said: \"When we joined the Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, we used to sit where the end was, \"meaning at the end of the group in order not to inconvenience anyone and make them get up\" (Abu Dawud).\n\nAnother important rule of conduct at assemblies is to take the initiative when entering by greeting the people already there. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, said: \"Do not admit a person who does not begin with a greeting\" (AbuYa'la).There are many ahadith on the subject of making the salutation of others a common practice. In one of these, the Prophet states: \"O People! Spread greetings. Offer food. Keep in touch with your blood relatives. And pray while people are asleep. And you will be admitted into Paradise in peace\" (Tirmithi).\n\nWhen leaving a group, it is proper for a Muslim to commend the people there with salutations of peace, for die Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, said: \"If one of you joins an assembly, let him greet (the People there). And if he gets up while others are still sitting, let him greet (them). For the former (greeting) is not more of an obligation than the latter\" (Ahmed and Abu Dawud).\n\nWhen Muslims visit one another, they should not stay overly long. Once they have achieved what they came for, they should depart, in order not to inconvenience the host. That is why Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, says: \"And when you are told, 'Arise,' then arise,\" which means that when one is asked to get up and leave, one should do so. Abdurrahman ibn Zaid said: \"People used to gather at the house of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, and when they wanted to leave, each desired to be the last to leave him, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam. That made things hard for Allah's Messenger. Therefore, they were ordered to leave.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is proper for Muslims when sitting with others that they should be both modest and attentive in the way they sit. They should not keep turning their heads in all directions without cause, lest they arouse suspicion and wariness. Nor should they keep clearing their throats for no reason.\n\nIf someone sneezes and then praises Allah (saying alhamdulillah), the people around should respond with a prayer for Allah's mercy for him. When yawning, the mouth should be covered and further yawning resisted as much as possible. One should not sit with one's back to other people. Moreover, in a group of three, it is not right for two to talk intimately and privately, leaving the third out.\n\nFinally, let the assembly conclude with the supplication mentioned in a hadith of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, narrated by Abu Hurairah winch says: \"When a person sits in an assembly, having engaged in much idle talk, and then says, before getting up: 'Glory and praise be to you my lord. There is no God other than You. I pray for your pardon and repent to you'-Allah forgives for him what he has done [meaning the idle talk] in that assembly\" (Tirmithi).\n\n*****\n\nArticle provided by Al Jumuah Magazine, a monthly Muslim lifestyle publication, which addresses the religious concerns of Muslim families across the world.\n\nTo subscribe please visit https://www.aljumuah.com/subscription"

        "title": "Islamic Social Etiquette",
        "text": "Umm Saad highlights the noble mannerism and grace portrayed by Allah’s Messenger (sa) in times when ignorance and indecency was rife.\n\nAllah (swt) states in the holy Quran: “Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah (swt) Muhammad (sa) you have a good example to follow, if you hope for (the meeting with) Allah (swt) and the Last Day, and remember Allah (swt) much.” (Al-Ahzab 33:21)\n\nTherefore, the Prophet (sa) is the best role model for every Muslim that has provided numerous examples in every aspect of human behaviour. The following pearls from his social etiquettes are enlightening.\n\nSpreading the greeting of Salam\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (sa) commanded us to do seven things: to visit the sick, to attend funerals, to bless a Muslim, when he sneezes, to support the weak, to help the one, who is oppressed, to spread Salam (peace), and to help people fulfil their oaths. (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nHe also said: “By the One, in whose hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise, until you believe, and you will not believe, until you love one another. Shall I not tell you of something that if you do, you will love one another? Spread Salam amongst yourselves.” (Muslim)\n\nUnfortunately, today in Islamic societies this greeting has been replaced by foreign ones, especially among new generations, who are either ashamed or consider it old-fashioned to use the Islamic greeting. Obviously, they are unaware that a simple ‘Assalam Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatahu’ can earn them thirty rewards from Allah (swt)!\n\nNot entering anyone’s house without his permission\n\nAllah (swt) commands: “O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and saluted those in them: that is best for you, in order that you may take heed.” (An-Nur 24:27)\n\nIslam urges Muslims to do the following, when visiting others: “Whenever the Prophet (sa) came to a door seeking permission to enter, he did not stand facing it. He would stand to the right or to the left, and if he was given permission, he would enter; otherwise, he would leave.” (Bukhari)\n\nImpatiently ringing the doorbell, yelling out the in mates name, and grumbling, when the person we had intended to visit is unavailable, are signs of impoliteness and impertinence. They have no room in a Muslim’s life.\n\nSitting wherever one finds room in a gathering\n\nIn a gathering, a Muslim should sit wherever he finds space. He is neither to push through the people in order to sit at the head of the gathering, nor make another give up his space for him. The Prophet (sa) taught his companions to adopt these etiquettes, when joining a gathering.\n\nJabir Ibn Samurah (rta) said: “When we came to the Prophet (sa), we would sit, wherever we found room.” (Abu Dawood and Tirmidhi)\n\nThe Messenger of Allah (sa) said: “None of you should make another get up, then sit in his place. All of you should move up and make space (for the latecomer).” (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nThe basic instruction is to accommodate and show courtesy. Nowadays, it is common not to leave any space available, because of improper seating arrangements, and the latecomer is usually forced to stand. Similarly, some make grand arrivals without realizing the disturbance they cause to an ongoing gathering or speech.\n\nAvoiding yawning in a gathering\n\nThe Prophet (sa) advised Muslims: “If any of you wants to yawn, then let him suppress it as much as possible.” (Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nIf the urge to yawn cannot be resisted, then a Muslim should cover his mouth with his hand. The Prophet (sa) commanded: “If any of you yawns, let him cover his mouth with his hand, so that the Shaytan does not enter.” (Muslim)\n\nYawning is not only rude but a sign of boredom that may hurt the feelings of others. Even the very sophisticated manage to shock you, when they open their mouths as wide as a hippopotamus in the middle of a conversation.\n\nFollowing the Islamic etiquette, when sneezing\n\nIslam also teaches a Muslim, what he should say, when he sneezes, and what he should say, when he hears another sneeze.\n\nAbu Hurairah (rta) said: “The Prophet (sa) said: ‘Allah (swt) likes the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning. When any one of you sneezes and says ‘Alhamdulillah’, then he has the right to hear every Muslim say – ‘Yarhamuk Allah’. But yawning is from Shaytan, so if anyone of you feels the urge to yawn, he should resist it as much as he can, for when any of you yawns, the Shaytan laughs at him.’” (Bukhari)\n\nNot looking into other people’s houses\n\nA true Muslim does not spy on his host or pry into that, which does not concern him. The Prophet (sa) warned those, who let their gaze wander in gatherings in an attempt to see things that are none of their business.\n\nThe Prophet (sa) said: “Whoever looks into someone’s house without his permission, then it is permissible for the people of the house to take his eyes out.” (Muslim)\n\nNot finding fault with others\n\nThe Prophet (sa) issued a stern warning against the danger of slandering other people’s honour and exposing their faults.\n\nThe Prophet (sa) said: “Do not hurt the feelings of the servants of Allah (swt), do not embarrass them, do not seek to expose their faults; whoever seeks to expose the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah (swt) will seek to expose his faults and expose him, even if he hides in the innermost part of his home.” (Ahmad)\n\nApart from the above, there are numerous other social etiquettes that will be discussed in future issues, Insha’Allah."

        "title": "The Islamic Greeting and it’s Etiquette",
        "text": "Bismillahir ar-Rahmanir ar-Rahim\n\nIslam has professed the use of the Islamic greeting when encountering another Muslim or leaving the company of another Muslim because it unifies the hearts and strengthens bonds between Muslims.\n\nMuslim reported that the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “I swear by the one whose hand my soul is in that you will not enter paradise until you believe. And you won’t be believed until you love one another. May I tell you something, that if you practice it you will love another, spread the (salam) Islamic greeting among you.” This makes it clear to us, that spreading salam among Muslims is the first step towards paradise. This is because spreading salam leads to increasing the love between our hearts. And the increase of love between our hearts will increase the Iman, (faith).\n\nAn authentic hadith reported by Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah that the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: “Oh you people, spread salam among you, serve the food, behave kindly with your blood relations, and offer prayer at night when others are asleep, and you will enter paradise safely.” And Imams Bukhari and Muslim reported that a man asked the prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) “what in Islam is the best?” He (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) answered, “To feed people and to say salam to everyone whether you know them or not.”\n\nWhat is the history of the Islamic greeting, when did it start, and who was the one who chose it?\n\nBukhari and Muslim reported that the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When Allah created Adam he told him to go and say Assalamu Alikum to a group of Angels and listen to their reply. It is your greeting and the greeting of your descendants. Adam went and said: Assalamu Alikum they said Assalamu Alikum Wa Rahmatulah.”\n\nThe complete form for the Islamic greeting is Assalamu Alilkum Wa Rahmatulah Wa Barakatuh meaning peace, mercy, and blessings be upon from Allah (Subhanhu Wa Ta’ala). This is because Abu-Dawood and Tirmidhi reported in a good hadith that a man came to the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said, “Assalamu Alikum.” The prophet responded and the man sat down. The Prophet said, “Ten rewards.” Another man came and said, “Assalamu Alikum Wa Rahmatullh.” The prophet responded and the man sat down. The prophet said, “twenty rewards.”\n\nThen another man came and said: Assalamu Alakum Wa Rahmatulah Wa Barakatuh. The prophet responded and the man sat down. The prophet said, “thirty rewards.”\n\nThe Scholars have agreed that starting with salam is highly recommended. And responding is obligatory because Allah (Subhanhu Wa Ta’ala) said in surat An-Nisaa, (verse 86), what can be translated as, “When a courteous greeting is offered to you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or at least of equal courtesy.”\n\nIt is enough for one to say the Islamic greeting to a group and it is enough for one of the group to return it. This is the meaning of the two ahadith that were reported by Abu Dawood and Malik.\n\nFrom the Etiquette of Salam:\n\nThe one who comes greets the Muslims that are present.\n\nThe one who is riding greets the one who is walking.\n\nThe one who is walking greets the one who is sitting.\n\nThe smaller group greets the bigger group.\n\nThe young greet the elder.\n\nImams Bukhari and Muslim reported that the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “A rider should greet a pedestrian, a pedestrian should greet one who is sitting, and a small party should greet a large party, a younger should greet an elder one.”\n\nSalams are recommended when leaving as well as when you meet. Abu-Dawoud, and Tirmidhi reported in a good hadith that the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “When one of you joins a gathering he should greet those present; and when he leave them he should greet them because the first salutation is not better than the last one.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Islam say about saying salams to the People of the Book?\n\nThe majority of scholars reported that starting with Assalamu Alikum is not permitted. They refer to the hadith of the prophet that was reported by Imam Muslim in which the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “Don’t start with the (salam) Islamic greeting when encountering Jews or Christians.”\n\nSome scholars see no problem in starting with the Islamic greeting. Some of the Shafies agree with this. This is the opinion of Ibn-Abbas one of the companions of the prophet. He said that this hadith was special for the Jewish of Quraizah, not for all of the people of the book.\n\nWhat if the people of the book start with the salams with the Muslims. Some of the scholars, like Ahnaf say that it is allowed to returnsalam and others say it’s obligatory.\n\nIbn Abbass said, “Whoever says Assalamu Alakum to you, you have to return his greeting even if he was a Majos (fire-worshipper). He was referring to a verse from surat An-Nisaa (verse 86), what can be translated as, “When a courteous greeting is offered to you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or at least of equal courtesy.”\n\nThe scholar had agreed upon starting the greeting with the non-Muslims is allowed with any word but Assalamu Alikum, like good morning, how are you?\n\nWhen meeting another Muslim shaking hands is highly recommended, along with a great smile, because it increases the love and respect among Muslims.\n\nIt was reported by Imam Bukhari that Qatadah asked Anass (RadiAllahu Anhu) if shaking hands was practiced by the companion at the time of the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam). He said, “Yes.”\n\nShaking hands with another Muslim will result in forgiveness from Allah (Subhanhu Wa Ta’ala). Abu Dawood and Tirmidhi reported that the Prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said, “If Muslims meet and shake hands with each other, they will be forgiven before they leave.”\n\nTirmidhi reported a good hadith that a man said: “O messenger of Allah if one of us meets his brother or friend, should he bend down to him? The Prophet said, “ No.” He asked should he hug him and kiss him? The Prophet answered, “No.” He asked should he take his hand and shake it. The Prophet answered, “Yes.”\n\nTirmidhi reported that Anass (RadiAllahu Anhu) said, “When the prophet use to meet a man, he shook hands with him and the prophet (Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam) would not pull away his hand until the man would pull his hand away first.”"

These greetings are commonly used across Arabic-speaking regions, conveying warmth and respect.\n\nUnderstanding Arabic greetings and their cultural significance\n\nIf you need to know how to say hello in Arabic, the first distinction you need to make is between religious and non-religious greetings.\n\nNot all Arabic speakers are Muslims, however, the most common way to say hello in Arabic is the Islamic greeting “As-salamu alaikum”, which means “Peace be upon you”. The non-religious way to greet someone in Arabic would be to say “ahlan”. Both of these Arabic greetings have set responses:\n\nGreeting Response Hello (religious) As-salamu alaikum السلام عليكم Wa-alaikum as-salam وعليكم السلام Hello (non-religious) Ahlan أهلاً Ahlan beek أهلاً بيك\n\nGreetings in Arabic change depending on the time of day. Saying “good morning” in Arabic is “sabah al kheir” and “kheir” means “goodness”. The literal translation is “morning of goodness” and the response to this would be to change “goodness” to an equally positive word, such as “flowers” or “light”.\n\nGreeting Response Good morning Sabah al-kheir صباح الخير Morning of light Sabah al-noor صباح النور Good evening Masaa al-kheir مساء الخير Evening of flowers Masaa al-ward مساء الورد\n\nAs with English, the equivalent of “good night” is not often used as a greeting but rather when saying goodbye.\n\nFormal greetings and responses in Arabic\n\nThere are both religious and non-religious ways to greet and respond to others in Arabic. Saying hello is often followed by the question “how are you?” There are several ways to say this depending on who you are speaking to.\n\nGreeting Response How are you? Kaefa haaluk? كيف حالك Good thanks (religious) Bekheir alhamdulilah بخير الحمدلله Good thanks (non-religious) Bekheir shukran بخير شكراً And you? Wa ant? (m) Wa anti? (f) وأنت؟\n\nInformal greetings and responses in Arabic\n\nThere is an exhaustive list because each dialect of Arabic has a different way of saying this but here are some examples:\n\nGreeting Response Levantine Arabic How’s it going? Keefak? كيفك؟ I’m fine Mneeh (m) Mneeha (f) منيح Egyptian Arabic Akhbarik eeh? أخبارك إيه؟ Kwayis (m) Kwayisa (f) كويس\n\nArabic basic phrases\n\nBeyond the first encounter, you will definitely want to learn more ways of interacting with your Arabic speaking counterparts. You’ll need to be polite, saying thanks and even apologizing at times. Later, you’ll also need to be able to ask some basic questions in Arabic. So let’s dig in.\n\nSaying thanks and responding\n\nPhrase Response Thank you Shukran شكراً You’re welcome Afwan عفواً Thank you very much Shukran jazeelan شكراً جزيلاً May god reward you (religious) Jazakallah kheir جزاك الله خير And you Wa iyak kheir وإياك خير\n\nWith family and friends, it is common to say “min eyooni” instead of “afwan”. It literally means “from my eyes”.\n\nApologizing in Arabic\n\nThese Arabic words and phrases for apologies increase in intensity. You may use the first when trying to get past someone in the street or if you didn’t hear what someone said. However, the latter two are for apologizing for something you did wrong. “Samahni” in particular is quite formal, and used if you have really offended someone.\n\nPhrase Response Excuse me / pardon me Afwan / lo samaht عفواً / لو سمحت Forgiveness Al-afuw العفو Sorry Asif أسف No worries Hasal kheir حصل خير Forgive me Samahni سامحني\n\nBasic questions\n\nNow that you’ve mastered a few first words, you’re going to be eager to dive deeper. Here are some basic questions to get to know someone better, and a couple that might make your life easier when traveling in an Arabic-speaking country.\n\nPhrase Response What’s your name? Ma huwa ismuk? Shu ismuk? (informal) ما هو اسمك؟ شو اسمك؟ My name is… Ismee… [name] Ana…[name] إسمي… أنا … Where are you from? Min aina ant? Inta min ween? (informal) من أين أنت؟ إنت من وين؟ I am from… Ana min… أنا من… Do you speak another language? Hel tatakalum lugha ukhra? هل تتكلم لغة أخرى؟ Yes, I speak… No, sorry. Na’am, itakalam… La, asif. نعم، أتكلم… لا، أسف. Pardon me, where is the restroom? Lo samaht, ain al hamam? لو سمحت، أين الحمام؟ There Hunak هناك How much is this? Bikam hatha? بكم هذا؟ `\n\nArabic farewells\n\nThere is also a religious and non-religious way of saying goodbye in Arabic. It is worth mentioning that ”ila al liqaa” is not often used since it is very formal. It literally means “until we meet again” and is really only heard on news programs or in Modern Standard Arabic cartoons.\n\nUnlike saying hello, responses to saying goodbye are often the same as the greeting and can be used interchangeably.\n\nGreeting and response Bye (religious) Fi aman illa Allah ma’ik في أمان الله الله معك Bye (non-religious) Ma’assalama Illa al-liqaa مع السلامة إلا اللقاء Goodnight Tisbah ‘ala kheir تصبح على خير\n\nEtiquette in Arabic countries\n\nArabic is a language that places a lot of importance on etiquette and politeness. In Arab culture, between friends and family, this is less important than with strangers and superiors, but even then there are still certain rules.\n\nThis is not always reflected in language and there are a number of common gestures. For example, it’s common to stand up when someone enters the room, or wait until the host is sitting at the table and invites everyone to start eating.\n\nReferring to elders in Arabic is important. Usually, first names are not used unless you are told to or you are a similar age and familiar with someone. Formally, you can refer to someone as “Parent of” their eldest child, and informally you can call them aunt or uncle.\n\nTo an elder or a stranger you might use the formal pronoun “hadartik”. For example, “meen hadartik” is a polite way of asking “who are you?” This is particularly common to use while speaking on the phone to ask who is calling.\n\nPhrase Please Min fadlek / lo samaht من فضلك / لو سمحت Welcome Ahlan wa sahlan أهلاً وسهلاً Please come in / please help yourself Tfadel (m) Tfadelee (f) تفضل تفضلي Mother of… / Father of… Umm… (f) / Abo…(m) أم… / أبو… Auntie / uncle Khala (f), Amo (m) خالة / عام Formal pronoun Hadartik حضرتك\n\nThe first step on the path to learning Arabic\n\nSo there you have it, some basic Arabic greetings and simple phrases so you can hold a polite conversation. These are the essential ingredients you’ll need to start speaking and interacting with real Arabic-speaking people. They will open the door to new knowledge, a fascinating culture and untold opportunities in the future.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Arab culture and language with the help of a teacher, take your first online Arabic class on Preply."

        "text": "The Beauty of Muslim Greetings: A Gateway to Connection and Blessings\n\nThe Muslim greeting, “As-salamu alaykum” (peace be upon you), is far more than a simple exchange of words. It is a profound act of worship, a reminder of faith, and a means of strengthening bonds among Muslims. Rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, this beautiful greeting carries deep spiritual significance and conveys the core values of Islam: peace, kindness, and mutual respect.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the meaning and etiquette of the Muslim greeting, its rewards, and how it serves as a cornerstone of building harmonious relationships in the Muslim community.\n\nWhat Does “As-Salamu Alaykum” Mean?\n\nThe Arabic phrase “As-salamu alaykum” translates to “Peace be upon you.” This greeting embodies a wish for peace, security, and blessings from Allah for the person being addressed. It’s a way of expressing good intentions and fostering unity among Muslims.\n\nThe complete version of the greeting is:\n\n“As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh”\n\n(Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings)\n\nThis extended version adds an even greater sense of goodwill and invokes Allah’s mercy and blessings for the recipient.\n\nWhy Is the Muslim Greeting Important?\n\n1. A Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him)\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) placed great emphasis on the practice of exchanging greetings. He said:\n\n“You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I tell you something that will increase love among you? Spread Salam among yourselves.”\n\n(Sahih Muslim)\n\nThis hadith highlights the greeting as a means to strengthen bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood, fostering a sense of community and mutual love.\n\n2. A Source of Reward\n\nGreeting others with Salam is not just polite—it’s rewarded by Allah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\n\n“The one who is first to greet with Salam is free from pride.”\n\n(Abu Dawood)\n\nMoreover, responding to Salam is obligatory, making it an interactive act of worship.\n\nThe Etiquette of Greeting in Islam\n\n1. Initiating the Greeting\n\nMuslims are encouraged to initiate the greeting whenever they meet others, whether family, friends, or strangers.

Responding to Salam\n\nWhen greeted, it is obligatory to respond with an equal or better greeting, as Allah commands in the Quran:\n\n“And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with one better than it or at least return it.”\n\n(Surah An-Nisa, 4:86)\n\nFor example, if someone says “As-salamu alaykum,” a better response would be “Wa alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.”\n\n3. Greeting Non-Muslims\n\nMuslims are encouraged to extend kindness and good will to all people. When greeting non-Muslims, it is permissible to use phrases such as “Good morning” or “Hello” while maintaining respect and courtesy.\n\nThe Power of Greeting: Building Community and Spreading Peace\n\nThe greeting of Salam serves as a daily reminder of Islam’s core values—peace, love, and unity. Here’s how it contributes to building a stronger Muslim community:\n\nFostering Unity:\n\nGreeting others with Salam creates a sense of belonging and reduces barriers between individuals. Promoting Peace:\n\nThe wish for peace embedded in the greeting reminds Muslims to embody peace in their actions and words. Strengthening Bonds:\n\nRegularly exchanging Salam strengthens relationships, whether among family members, friends, or fellow community members.\n\nHow to Teach and Spread the Practice of Salam\n\nIf you want to make Salam a consistent part of your life or teach it to others, consider the following:\n\nLead by Example: Make it a habit to greet others with Salam, whether at home, in the mosque, or in public.\n\nMake it a habit to greet others with Salam, whether at home, in the mosque, or in public.

        "title": "SAHIH MUSLIM, Book 26 : The Book of Salutions and Greetings (KITAB AS-SALAM)",
        "text": "KITAB AS-SALAM\n\n(THE BOOK ON SALUTIONS AND GREETINGS)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nJust as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one's mornings and evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the time of meeting are as-Salam-u-'Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind. peace amongst individuals and nations.-The second important feature of words of greeting in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the blessing of peace. (The pronoun 'Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come within its orbit.) The two words as-Salam-u-'Alaikum may be called the irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-'Alaikum are generally suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings). These three words: \"peace... ,mercy\" and \"blessings of Allah\" in fact form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. According to Imam Nawawi, greeting with the words of as-Salam-u-'Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for it.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The rider should first greet the pedestrian, and the pedestrian the one who is seated and a small group should greet a larger group (with as-Salam-u-'Alaikum).\n\nAbu Talha reported: While We were sitting in front of the houses and talking amongst ourselves, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to come there. He stood by us and said: What about you apd your meetings on the paths? Avoid these meetings on the paths. We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation amongst ourselves. Thereupon he said: If there is no help (for you but to sit on these paths), then give the paths their rights and these are lowering of the gaze, exchanging of greetings and good conversation.\n\nAbu Sa'id Khudri reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying : Avoid sitting on the paths. They (the Companions) said: Allah's Messenger, we cannot help but holding our meetings (in these paths) and discuss matters (there). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If you insist on holding meetings, then give the path its due right. They said: What are its due rights ? Upon this he said: Lowering the gaze, refraining from doing harm, exchanging of greetings. commanding of good and forbidding from evil.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zaid b. Aslam with the same chain of transmitters.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Five are the rights of a Muslim over his brother: responding to salutation, saying Yarhamuk Allah when anybody sneezes and says al-Hamdulillah, visiting the sick. following the bier.' Abd al-Razzaq said that this hadith has been transmitted as mursal hadith from Zuhri and he then substantiated it on the authority of Ibn Musayyib.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Six are the rights of a Muslim over another Muslim. It was said to him: Allah's Messenger, what are these? Thereupon he said: When you meet him, offer him greetings;when he invites you to a feast accept it. when he seeks your council give him, and when he sneezes and says: \"All praise is due to Allah,\" you say Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah show mercy to you); and when he fails ill visit him; and when he dies follow his bier.\n\nAnas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When the People of the Book offer you salutations, you should say: The same to you.\n\nAnas reported that the Companions of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: The People.of the Book offer us salutations (by saying as-Salamu- 'Alaikum). How should we reciprocate them ? Thereupon he said: Say: Wa 'Alaikum (and upon you too).\n\nIbn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When the Jews offer you salutations, tome of them say as-Sam-u-'Alaikum (death be upon you). You should say (in response to it): Let it be upon you.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn 'Umar through another chain of transmitters with a slight variation of wording.\n\n'A'isha reported that a group of Jews came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and sought his audience and said: As-Sam-u-'Alaikum. A'isha said in response: As-Sim-u-'Alaikum (death be upon you) and curse also, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said : 'A'isha, verily Allah loes kindness in every matter. She said: Did you bear what they said ? Thereupon he said: Did you not hear that I said (to them): Wa 'Alaikum.\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Zuhri that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I said 'Alaikam, and the transmitter did not make mention of the word \"and\".\n\n'A'isha reported that some Jews came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and they said: Abu'l-Qasim (the Kunya of the Holy Prophet), as-Sam-u-'Alaikum, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Wa 'Alaikum. A'isha reported: In response to these words of theirs, I said: But let there be death upon you and disgrace also, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: 'A'isha, do not use harsh words. She said: Did you hear what they said? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Did I not respond to them when they said that; I said to them: Wa'Alaikum (let it be upon you).\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of A'znash with a slight variation of wording. 'A'isha understood their meaning and cursed them and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: 'A'isha. (do not do that) for Allah does not like the use of harsh words, and it was at this stage that this verse of Allah. the Exalt. ed and Glorious. was revealed: \"And when they come to thee, they greet thee with a greeting with which Allah greets thee not\" (Iviii. 8) to the end of the verse.\n\nJabir b. Abdullah reported that some people from amongst the Jews said to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) Abu'l-Qasim. as-Sam-u-'Alaikum, whereupon he said : Wa 'Alaikum, A'isha was enraged and asked him (Allah's Apostle) whether he had not heard what they had said. He said, I did hear and I retorted to them (and the curse that I invoked upon them would receive response from Allah), but (the curse that they invoked upon us) would not be responded.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not greet the Jews and the Christians before they greet you and when you meet any one of them on the roads force him to go to the narrowest part of it .\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Suhail with the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording. The hadith transmitted on the authority of Waki', the words are 'When you meet the Jews.\" And in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Shu'ba, the words are: 'When you meet the People of the Book.\" And in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Jarir the words are: \"When you meet them,\" but none amongst the polytheists has been mentioned explicitly by name.\n\nAnas b. Malik reported that when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened to pass by young boys he would great them. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sayyar with the same chain of transmitters.\n\nSayyar reported: I was walking with Thibit al-Bunani that he happened to pass by children and he greeted them. And Thibit reported that he walked with Anas and he happened to pass by children and he greeted them. and Anas reported that he walked with Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon.him) and he happened,to pass by children and he greeted them.\n\nIbn Mas'ud reported : The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to me : The sign that you have been permitted to come in is that the curtain is raised or that you hear me speaking quietly until I forbid you.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of 'Ubaidullah with the same chain of transmitters.\n\nA'isha reported that Sauda (Allah he pleated with her) went out (in the fields) in order to answer the call of nature even after the time when veil had been prescribed for women. She had been a bulky lady, significant in height amongst the women, and she could not conceal herself from him who had known her. 'Umar b. Khattab saw her and said: Sauda, by Allah, you cannot conceal from us. Therefore, be careful when you go out. She ('A'isha) said : She turned back. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was at that time in my house having his evening meal and there was a bone in his hand. She (Sauda) cline and said: Allah's Messenger.

He had neither land nor wealth nor slave nor anything else like it except a bom. She further said: I grazed his horse. provided fodder to it and looked after it, and ground dates for his camel. Besides this, I grazed the camel, made arrangements for providing it with water and patched up the leather bucket and kneaded the flour. But I was not proficient in baking the bread, so my female neighbours used to bake bread for me and they were sincere women. She further said: I was carrying on my head the stones of the dates from the land of Zubair which Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had endowed him and it was at a distance of two miles (from Medina). She add: As I was one day carrying the atones of dates upon my head I happened to meet Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with a group of his Companions. He called me and said (to the camel) to sit down so that he should make cite ride behind hirn. (I told my husband:) I felt shy and remembered your jealousy, whereupon he said: By Allah. the carrying of the stone dates upon your bead is more severe a burden than riding with him. She said: (I led the life of hardship) until Abu Bakr sent afterwards a female servant who took upon herself the responsibility of looking after the horse and I felt as it she had emancipated me.\n\nAsma' reported: I performed the household duties of Zubair and he had a horse; I used to look after it. Nothing was more burdensome for me than looking after the horse I used to bring grass for it and looked after it, then I got a servant as Allah's Apustle (may peace be upon him) had some prisoners of war in his possession. He gave me a female servant. She (the female servant) then began to look after the horse and thus relieved me of this burden. A person came and he said: Mother of 'Abdullah, I am a destitute person and I intend that I should start business under the shadow of your house. I (Asma') said: If I grant you permission, Zubair may not agree to that, so you come and make a demand of it when Zubair is also present there. He came accordingly find said: Mother of 'Abdullah. I am a destitute person. I intend to start t mall business in the shadow of your house. I said: Is there not in Medina (any place for starting the business) except my house ? Zubair said: Why is it that you prohibit the destitute man to start business here? So he started business and he (earned so much) that we sold our slave-girl to him There came Zubair to me while the money was in my lap. He said: Give this to me. I said: (I intend) to spend it as charity.\n\nIbn Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When there are three (persons), two should not converse secretly between themselves to the exclusion of the (third) one.\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of lbn 'Umar through two different chains of transmitters.\n\n'Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you are three, two amongst you should not converse secretly between yourselves to the exclusion of the other (third one), unti some other people join him (and dispel his loneliness), for it may hurt his feelings.\n\n'Abdullah reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you are three, two should not converse secretly to the exclusion of your companion for that hurts his feelings.\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of A'mash with the same chain of transmitters.\n\n'A'isha (the wife of Allah's Apostle) said: When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) fell ill.

Zaid and Sa'd had been sitting and they had been conversing and they said this: This hadith has been transmitted by Ibrahim b. Sa'd b. Malik on the authority of his father.\n\n'Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported: Umar b. Khattab set out for Syria. As he came at Sargh (a town by the side of Hijaz on the way to Syria), there met him the commander of the forces, Abu Ubaida b. Jandb, and his companions. They informed him that a scourge had broken out in Syria. Ibn 'Abbas further reported that 'Umar said: Call to me tile earliest emigrants. So I called them. He (Hadrat 'Umar) sought their advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a difference of opinion (whether they should proceed further or go back to their homes in such a situation). Some of them said: You ('Umar) have set forth for a task, and, therefore, we would not advise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along with you the remnants (of the sacred galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so we would not advise you to go forth towards this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose them deliberately to a danger). He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: You can now go away. He said: Call to me the Ansar. So I called them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden by the Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can go. He again said: Call to me the old persons of the Quraish who had migrated before the Victory (that is the Victory of Mecca), so I called them (and 4mt 'Umar consulted them) and not even two persons differed (from the opinion held by the earlier delegates). They said: Our opinion is that you better go back along with the people and do not make them go to this scourge, So 'Umar made announcement to the people: In the morning I would be on the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), whereupon Abu 'Ubaida b. Jarrah said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree ? Thereupon 'Umar said: Had it been someone else to say this besides you! 'Umar (in fact) did not approve of his opposing (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren, would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure ? And in case you graze them in the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according to the Divine Decree.\n\nThere happened to come 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf and he had been absent in connection with some of his needs. He said: I have with me a knowledge of it, that I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you hear of its presence (the presence of plague) in a land, don't enter it, but if it spreads in the land where you are, don't fly from it. Thereupon 'Umar b. Khattab praised Allah and then went back?\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of Ma'mar with the same chain of transmitters but with this addition: \"Do you think that he would graze in the barren land but would abandon the green land? Would you not attribute it to be a failing on his part ? He said: Yes. He said: Then proceed. And he moved on until he came to Medina. And he said to me: This is the right place, or he said: That is the destination if Allah so wills.\" This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Harith with a slight variation of wording.\n\n'Amir b. Rabi'ah reported: 'Umar went to Syria and as he came to Sargh, information was given to him that an epidemic had broken out in Syria. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf narrated to him that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said: When you hear of its presence in a land, don't move towards it, and when it breaks out in a land and you are therein, then don't run away from it. So 'Umar b. Khattab came back from Sargh. Salim b. 'Abdullah reported that 'Umar went back, along with people on hearing the hadith reported on the authority of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no infection, no safar, no hama. A desert Arab said: Allah's Messenger, how is it that when the camel is in the sand it is like a deer-then a camel afflicted with scab mixes with it and it is affected by sub ? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Who infected the first one?\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no evil omen, no safar, no hama. A desert Arab said: Allah's,Messenger.... The rest of the hadith is the same.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no trahsitive disease. Thereupon a desert Arab stood up. The rest of the hadith is the same and in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Zuhri' the Prophet (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: There is no transitive disease, no safar, no hama.\n\nAbu Salama h. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, but he is also reported to have said: A sick person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Abu Salama said that Abu Huraira used to narrate these two (different ahadith) from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), but afterwards Abu Huraira became silent on these words: \"There is no transitive disease,\" but he stuck to this that the sick person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Harith b. Abu Dhubab (and he was the first cousin of Abu Huraira) said: Abu Huraira, I used to hear from you that you narrated to us along with this hadith and the other one also (there is no transitive disease), but now you observe silence about it. You used to say that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: There is no transitive disease. Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith, however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said: No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it. Abu Salama sad: By my life, Abu Huraira in fact used to report Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said: There is no transitive disease. I do not know whether Abu Huraira has forgotten it or he deemed it an abrogated statement in the light of the other one.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease and he also reported along with it: The ill should not be taken to the healthy.\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no huma, no star promising rain, no safar.\n\nJabir reported Allal's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no ill omen, no ghoul.\n\nJabir reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no ghoul, no safar.\n\nJabir b. 'Abdullah reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no safar, no ghoul. He (the narrator) said: I heard Abu Zubair say: Jabir explained for them the word safar. Abu Zubair said: safar means belly. It was said to Jabir: Why is it so? He said that it was held that safar implied the worms of the belly, but he gave no explanation of ghoul. Abu Zubair said: Ghoul is that which kills the travellers.\n\nAbu Huraira reported: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no divination but the best type is the good omen. It was said to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him): What is good omen? Thereupon he said: A good word which one of you hears.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.\n\nAnas reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no divination, but good omen pleases me, i.e. the good word or a good word.\n\nAnas b. Malik reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no divination, but good omen pleases me. It was said: What is good omen? He said: Sacred words.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no divination, but I like good words.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There is no transitive disease, no hama, no divination, but I like good omen.\n\n'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If there be bad luck, it is in the house, and the wife, and the horse.\n\n'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying. There is no transitive disease, no ill omen, and bad luck is lound in the house, or wife or horse.\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of Zuhri with other chains of transmitters but with slight variations of wording.\n\n'Umar b. Muhammad b. Zaid reported that he heard his father narrating from Ibn 'Umar that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said. If bad luck is a fact, then it is in the horse, the woman and the house.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters but there is no mention of the word \"Haqq\"\" (fact).\n\n'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported on the authority of his father that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If there is bad luck in anything, it is the horse, the abode and the woman.\n\nSahl b. Sa'd reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If bad luck were to be in anything, it is found in the woman, the horse and the abode.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Sahl b. Sa'd with a difterent chain of transmitters.\n\nJabir reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If bad luck were to be in anything, it is found in the land, in the servant and in the horse.\n\nMu'awiya b. al-Hakam as-Sulami reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, there were things we used to do in the pre-Islamic days. We used to visit Kahins, whereupon he said: Don't visit Kahins. I said: We used to take omens. He said: That is a sort of personal whim of yours, so let it not prevent you (from doing a thing).\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Zuhri with a slight variation of wording.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Mu'awiya b. Hakam as-Sulami through another chain of transmitters. The hadith transmitted on the authority of Yahya b. Abu Kathir (there is an addition of these words) : I said: Among us there are men who draw lines and thus make divination. What about this? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: There was a Prophet who drew lines, so whose lines agree with his line for him it is allowable.\n\n'A'isha reported: I said: Allah's Messenger, the kahins used to tell us about things (unseen) and we found them to be true. Thereupon he said: That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches and throws into the ear of his friend, and makes an addition of one hundred lies to it.\n\n'Urwa reported from 'A'isha that she said that people asked Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) about the kahins. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to them: It is nothing (i.e. it is a mere superstition). They said: Allah's Messenger, they at times narrate to us things which we find true. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches away and then cackles into the ear of his friend as the hen does. And then they mix in it more than one hundred lies.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.\n\n'Abdullah. Ibn 'Abbas reported: A person from the Ansar who was amongst the Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) reported to me: As we were sitting during the night with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), a meteor shot gave a dazzling light. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however,used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.\n\nThe hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri through the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.\n\nSafiyya reported from some of the wives of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) having said: He who visits a divner ('Arraf) and asks him about anything, his prayers extending to forty nights will not be accepted.\n\n'Amr b. Sharid reported on the authority of his father that there was in the delegation of Thaqif a leper. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) sent a message to him: We have accepted your allegiance, so you may go.\n\n'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded the killing of a snake having stripes over it, for it affects eyesight and miscarries pregnancy.\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Hisham. He said : The short-tailed snake and the snake having stripes over it should be killed.\n\nSalim, on the authority of his father. reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying : Kill the snakes having stripes over them and short-tailed snakes, for these two types cause miscarriage (of a pregnant woman) and they affect the eyesight adversely. So Ibn 'Umar used to kill every snake that he found. Abu Lubaba b. 'Abd al-Mundhir and Zaid b. Khattab saw him pursuing a snake, whereupon he said: They were forbidden (to kill) those snakes who live in houses.\n\nIbn 'Umar reported : I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanding the killing of dogs and the killing of the striped and the short-tailed snakes, for both of them affect the eyesight adversely and cause miscarriage. Zuhri said : We thought of their poison (the pernicious effects of these two). Allah, however, knows best. 'Abdullah b. 'Umar said: I did not spare any snake. I rather killed everyone that I saw. One day as I was pursuing a snake from amongst the snakes of the house, Zaid b. Khattab or Abu Lubaba happened to pass by me and found me pursuing it. He said: 'Abdullah, wait. I said: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded (us) to kill them, whereupon he said that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the killing of the snakes of the houses. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters but with a slight variation of wording.\n\nNafi' reported that Abu Lubaba talked to Ibn 'Umar to open a door in his house which would bring them nearer to the mosque and they found a fresh slough of the snake, whereupon 'Abdullah said: Find it out and kill it. Abu Lubaba said: Don't kill them, for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the killing of the snakes found in houses.\n\nNafi' reported that Ibn 'Urnar used to kill all types of snakes until Abu Lubaba b. 'Abd al-Mundhir Badri reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had forbidden the killing of the snakes of the houses, and so he abstained from it.\n\nNafi' reported that he heard Abu Lubaba informing Ibn 'Umar that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had forbidden the killing of domestic snakes.\n\n'Abdullah reported that Abu Lubaba had informed him that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had forbidden the killing of the snakes found in the house.\n\nNafi' reported that Abu Lubaba b. 'Abd al-Mundhir al-Ansari (first) lived in Quba. He then shifted to Medina and as he was in the company of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar opening a window for him, he suddenly saw a snake in the house. They (the inmates of the house) attempted to kill that. Thereupon Abu Lubaba said: They had been forbidden to make an attempt to kill house snakes and they had been commanded to kill the snakes having small tails, small snakes and those having streaks over them, and it was said: Both of them affect the eyes and cause miscarriage to women.\n\nNafi' reported on the authority of his father that as 'Abdullah b. 'Umar saw one day (standing) near the ruin (of his house) the slough of a snake and said (to the people around him): Pursue this snake and kill it. Abu Lubaba Ansari said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He forbade the killing of snakes found in the houses except the short-tailed snakes and those having streaks upon them, for both of them obliterate eyesight and affect that which is in the wombs of (pregnant) women.\n\nNafi' reported that Abu Lubaba happened to pass by Ibn 'Umar who lived in the fortified place near the house of 'Umar b. Khattab and was busy in keeping his eyes upon a snake and killing it, the rest of the hadith is the same.\n\n'Abdullah reported: We were with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) in a cave when there was revealed to him (the Sura al-Mursalat, i.e. Sura lxxvii.: \"By those sent forth to spread goodness\") and we had just heard (it) from his lips that there appeared before us a snake. He said: Kill it. We hastened to kill it, but it slipped away from us, thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah saved it from your harm just as he saved you from its evil.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of al-A'mash with the same chain of transmitters.\n\n'Abdullah reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded a Muhrim (one who is in the state of pilgrimage) to kill the snake at Mina.\n\n'Abdullah reported: While we were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the cave, the rest of the hadith is the same as the one narrated above.\n\nAbu as-Sa'ib, the freed slaved of Hisham b. Zuhra, said that he visited Abu Sa'id Khudri in his house, (and he further) said: I found him saying his prayer, so I sat down waiting for him to finish his prayer when I heard a stir in the bundles (of wood) lying in a comer of the house. I looked towards it and found a snake. I jumped up in order to kill it, but he (Abu Sa'id Khudri) made a gesture that I should sit down. So I sat down and as he finished (the prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who had been newly wedded. We went with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) (to participate in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) to return to his family. One day he sought permission from him and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) (after granting him the permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Quraiza (may harm you). The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a devil.\n\nAsma' b. 'Ubaid reported about a person who was called as-Sa'ib having said: We visited Abu Sa'id Khudri. When we had been sitting (with him) we heard a stir under his bed. When we looked we found a big snake, the rest of the hadith is the same. And in this Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Verily in these houses there live aged (snakes), so when you see one of them, make life hard for it for three days, and if it goes away (well and good), otherwise kill it for (in that case) it would be a nonbeliever. And he (the Holy Prophet) said (to his Companions): Go and bury your companion (who had died by the snake bite).\n\nAbu Sa'id Khudri reported Allah's Messenger having said: There is a group of jinns in Medina who accepted Islam, so he who would see anything from these occupants should warn him three times; and if he appears after that, he should kill him for he is a satan.\n\nUmm Sharik reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded her to kill geckos. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abi Shaiba with a slight variation of wording.\n\nUmm Sharik reported that she consulted Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) in regard to killing of geckos, and he commanded to kill them and Umm Sharik is one of the women of Bani 'Amir b. Luwayy. This hadith has been reported through another chain of transmitters with the same meaning.\n\n'Amir b. Sa'd reported on the authority of his father that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) commanded the killing of geckos, and he called them little noxious creatures.\n\n'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said about the gecko as a noxious creature\". Harmala made this addition that she said: I did not hear that he had commanded to kill them.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He who killed a gecko with the first stroke for him is such and such a reward, and he who killed it with a second stroke for him is such and such reward less than the first one, and he who killed it with the third stroke for him is such and such a reward less than the second one.\n\nThis hadith has been reported on the authority of Abu Huraira through another chain of transmitters (and the words are):- He who killed a gecko with the first stroke for him are ordained one hundred virtues, and with the second one less than that and with the third one less than that.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying (that he who kills a gecko) with the first stroke there are seventy rewards for him.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: An ant had bitten a Prophet (one amongst the earlier Prophets) and he ordered that the colony of the ants should be burnt. And Allah revealed to him: \"Because of an ant's bite you have burnt a community from amongst the communities which sings My glory.\"\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: An Apostle from amongst the Apostles of Allah encamped under a tree, and an ant bit him, and he commanded his belongings to be removed from underneath the tree. He then commanded and it was burnt, and Allah revealed to bin): \"Why one ant (which had bitten you) was not killed?\"\n\nAbu Huraira reported so many ahadith and one of them was this that Allah' Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: When an Apostle from amongst the Apostles of Allah came to sit under a tree an ant bit him. He commanded his luggage to be removed from under the tree and he commanded it to be burnt in the fire and Allah revealed to him: \"Why one ant (which had bitten you) was not killed (and why did you burn the others)?\n\nNafi' reported from 'Abdullah that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: A woman was punished because she had kept a cat tied until it died, and (as a punishment of this offence) she was thrown into the Hell. She had not provided it with food, or drink, and had not freed her so that she could eat the insects of the earth.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira through another chain of transmitters.\n\nThis hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ibn 'Umar also.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A woman was punished because of a cat. She had neither provided her with food nor drink, nor set her free so that she might eat the insects of the earth.\n\nThis hadith has been narrated on the authority of Hisham with the same chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of wording.\n\nAbu Huraira reported this hadith through another chain of transmitters.\n\nHammam b. Manabbih reported this hadith on the authority of Abu Huraira.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon 4im) as sayings: A person suffered from intense thirst while on a journey, when he found a well. He climbed down into it and drank (water) and then came out and saw a dog lolling its tongue on account of thirst and eating the moistened earth. The person said: This dog has suffered from thirst as I had suffered from it. He climbed down into the well, filled his shoe with water, then caught it in his mouth until he climbed up and made the dog drink it. So Allah appreciated this act of his and pardoned him. Then (the Companions around him) said: Allah's Messenger, is there for us a reward even for (serving) such animals? He said: Yes, there is a reward for service to every living animal.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may pace be upon him) as saying: A prostitute saw a dog moving around a well on a hot day and hanging out its tongue because of thirst. She drew water for it in her shoe and she was pardoned (for this act of hers)."
